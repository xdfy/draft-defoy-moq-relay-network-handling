  MOQ Relays for Support of High-Throughput Low-Latency Traffic in 5G
               draft-defoy-moq-relay-network-handling-02

Abstract

   This document describes a mechanism to convey information about media
   frames.  The information is used for specific handling in functions
   such as error recovery and congestion handling.  These functions can
   be critical to improve energy efficiency and network capacity in some
   (especially wireless) networks.  Due to end-to-end encryption, MOQ
   relays are expected to extract the metadata required by these
   functions.  This document aims to enable a level of wireless network
   support for MOQ equivalent to what is possible for RTP.

1.  Introduction

   Wireless networks can be a challenging environment for applications
   with high-throughput and low latency requirements, such as video
   conferencing and Extended Reality (XR, presented for example in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-mops-ar-use-case]).  Wireless networks implement
   techniques to improve network capacity and energy efficiency, as well
   as reduce the impact of packet losses on users' quality of experience
   (Section 1.1).  An extension to the RTP protocol has been defined,
   which enables metadata associated with application data units to be
   identified at the ingress point of the wireless network
   (Section 1.2).  To enable a similar operation with the MoQ protocol
   [I-D.draft-ietf-moq-transport], this document describes how a MOQ
   relay can be used at the ingress point of the wireless network
   (Section 1.3).

   The rest of this document is structured as follows:

   *  Section 2 describes XR metadata for MoQ, based on what is
      currently defined by 3GPP for RTP.

   *  Section 3 describes the behavior of the MOQ relay and of MOQ
      endpoints.

   *  Section 4 describes applicable security considerations.

1.1.  Techniques used by Wireless Networks for XR Traffic

   The network can handle groups of packets based on how critical they
   are to the user's experience.  Some groups of data packets hold
   application data units that are handled (e.g., decoded) together by
   the application. 3GPP defines the term "PDU set" to identify these
   groups of data packets carrying the payload of an application data
   unit [TS23.501], which can correspond to the data packets of an
   application layer data unit.  The handling of application data units
   by the application can depend on other application data units (e.g.,
   in the case of decoding dependency).  The wireless network performs
   differentiated handling of groups of data packets.  For example, it
   prioritizes some groups over others in case of congestion.  In
   congestion situations, the network can also selectively drop data
   packets that depend on an already lost data packets.  Furthermore,
   the network can limit the amount of time that the radio needs to stay
   awake to transmit and receive data.  To achieve this this, the
   scheduler can use information on the size and periodicity of traffic,
   as well as delay budget and maximum tolerable jitter specific to the
   application.

1.2.  Identifying XR Metadata in RTP Media Flows

   To perform differentiated handling of PDU sets, a network node
   (typically a User Plane Function, UPF) at the ingress point of a
   wireless network identifies PDU set metadata from a downlink media
   flow. 3GPP has developed an RTP header extension for XR traffic for
   this purpose (see Appendix A for details).  When receiving a downlink
   packet, the UPF reads the XR metadata fields from the RTP header
   extension and transmits them to the RAN node in the GTP header that
   encapsulates the packet.  The RAN node uses the XR metadata
   information to implement the differentiated handling described in
   Section 1.1.

1.3.  Identifying XR Metadata in MOQ flows

   For XR media traffic transported over the MOQ protocol, the UPF
   cannot access XR metadata unless it is exposed to the UPF in some
   fashion.  This document describes how the UPF can act as, or
   communicate with, a MOQ relay to obtain XR metadata associated with
   media data.  To enable this behavior, it is also necessary for the
   media sender to identify application data units that correspond to
   different desired traffic handling (e.g., different layers within a

   media frame), and provide associated metadata.  Figure 1 describes a
   UPF with a MOQ relay functionality, identifying XR metadata and
   transmitting it to access nodes, for example, for a media stream sent
   by B towards A and C.  For privacy and security, it is desirable that
   the MOQ relay, which can be operated by a network or service
   operator, does not have access to media data.  For interoperability,
   it is also desirable for these mechanisms to not be codec-specific.

2.  XR Metadata for 5G

2.1.  List of Currently Defined XR Metadata

   XR metadata applies to IP packets from the 5G system standpoint.
   Some metadata is the same for a group of IP packets (the PDU set),
   while some metadata varies per IP packet within the group.  Some
   metadata relates to a data burst, which may consist of one or more
   PDU sets sent together as one burst of data.

   3GPP defines metadata used for XR traffic handling:

   *  In the 3GPP release 18 (RTP header extension for PDU set marking,
      [TS26.522])

      -  The _PDU Set Importance_ (PSI, 4 bits) is the importance of
         this PDU Set compared to other PDU Sets within the same
         Multimedia Session.

      -  The _end PDU of PDU set_ (E, 1 bit) indicates the last PDU of
         the PDU set.

      -  The _end of data burst_ (D, 1 bit) indicates the last PDU of a
         data burst.

      -  The _PDU set sequence number_ (PSSN, 10 bits) identifies the
         PDU set.  The PSSN is incremented monotonically by 1 for each
         subsequent PDU set.



de Foy, et al.            Expires 1 March 2025                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draft            MOQ-EXT-NET-HANDLING               August 2024


      -  The _PDU Sequence Number within a PDU Set_ (PSN, 6 bits)
         identifies a PDU with the PDU set, starting from 0 and
         incremented monotonically for every PDU in the PDU set in the
         order of transmission from the sender.

      -  The _PDU set size_ (PSSize, 24 bits) is an optional field which
         indicates the total size, in bytes, of all PDUs of the PDU Set
         (including IP header and IP payload).

      -  The _number of PDUs in the PDU Set_ (NPDS, 16 bits) is an
         optional field which indicates the number of PDUs in the same
         PDU set.

   *  In the 3GPP release 19 (work in progress, in normative stage based
      on the conclusion of [TR23.700-70])

      -  The _Burst Size_ (BSize) describes the size of a burst of
         traffic, which includes one or more PDU sets.

      -  The _Time to Next Burst_ (TTNB) describes the time between the
         end of the present burst and the beginning of the next burst.

   The optional RTP header extension fields are included subjects to an
   SDP signaling offer/answer negotiation.

2.2.  Applying XR Metadata to MOQ

   Question #1: Should XR metadata for MOQ be worked on at the IETF or
   in 3GPP SA4 (like the RTP header extension work)?  For now, the
   authors are considering the following approach:

   *  Define XR metadata for MOQ within the IETF MOQ WG, since the MOQ
      protocol is still in development and some questions (like
      extension mechanisms) can be best addressed by the protocol
      designers.

   *  To limit the need for 3GPP-specific expertise, restrict the
      initial definition of XR metadata for MOQ to what has been defined
      by 3GPP for RTP, in Release 18 [TS26.522], and in Release 19
      (assuming the Release 19 work will be completed by the time this
      draft is finalized).

   Question #2: Should XR metadata be inferred from existing MOQ
   metadata or should XR metadata be explicit?  For now, the authors are
   considering the following approach:

   *  Derive XR metadata if there is no practical way to signal it
      explicitly in MOQ (e.g., E and PSN in stream mode).



de Foy, et al.            Expires 1 March 2025                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft            MOQ-EXT-NET-HANDLING               August 2024


   *  Use explicit metadata in other cases, to associate metadata with a
      stream or datagram.

   *  Based on discussions in the MOQ WG, if a XR metadata field is
      determined to be exactly equivalent to an existing MOQ metadata
      field, in all use cases, then the equivalent existing MOQ metadata
      field will be preferred.

   Our rationale for proposing this approach to question #2 includes:

   *  Metadata generation tools for the RTP header extension for XR can
      be reused to generate XR metadata for MOQ.

   *  It keeps XR metadata generation independent from the management of
      MOQ signaling, which reduces the risks for side effects and the
      need for heuristics in the MOQ relay to avoid those side effects.
      Future design evolutions of MOQ would also need to take into
      account its usage in 5G for XR.

      -  For example, in datagram mode, the boundaries of a PDU set may
         be an object (which would be the default heuristic choice) but
         it could also be a group.  Reusing MOQ object ID as PSSN for
         example, may not work in all cases.

      -  In another example, the priority in MOQ may or may not always
         align with PDU set importance, because the priority is for the
         application layer while the importance is for differentiated
         QoS handling in the network.

   *  Explicitly packaging XR metadata in MOQ can also simplify
      processing, since the suitability of a MOQ session for XR handling
      can be easily determined, based on the presence of explicit XR
      metadata.

   *  Some XR metadata is not covered by MOQ metadata today (e.g.,
      BSize, TTNB) and needs to be explicit.

   *  Using explicit signalling, the sender can determine which part of
      the data flow is in a PDU set, and which part is not in a PDU set.

      -  For example, in a QUIC session that includes MOQ XR streams and
         other streams, control or other application traffic, the sender
         can explicitly mark the MOQ XR streams with XR metadata.

   *  Finally, XR metadata can be extended or modified from one 3GPP
      release to the next, and explicit versions of XR metadata for MOQ
      can be defined in sync with the RTP header extension for XR,
      independently from other MOQ protocol aspects.

2.2.1.  MOQ Datagram XR Metadata

   When using MOQ in datagram mode, XR metadata is sent per datagram,
   since datagrams can be lost, and therefore sending per datagram is a
   way to ensure that the relevant metadata is always available when
   processing a datagram.

   The datagram XR header includes all XR metadata defined by 3GPP as
   part of the RTP header extension.

   *  Mandatory fields:

      -  E (1)

      -  D (1)

      -  PSI (4)

      -  PSSN (10)

      -  PSN (6)

   *  Optional fields are dependent on application-layer signalling to
      be present (e.g., based on indications in publication and
      subscription messages, while the support of these optional fields
      would be indicated in the catalog).

      -  PSSize (24)

      -  NPDS (16)

   *  Additional fields are conditional to completion of the RTP header
      extension work in Release 19 of 3GPP.

      -  BSize should be present in the first PDU of a burst

      -  TTNB should be signalled in the last PDU of a burst

2.2.2.  MOQ Stream XR Metadata

   When using MOQ in stream mode, explicit XR metadata applies to the
   whole stream.  There is little gain in providing a differentiated QoS
   for different portions of a same stream, since stream data is usable
   only when received in sequential order.  Therefore, in stream mode,
   each stream should be a PDU set, which means XR metadata applies to
   the whole stream.

Internet-Draft            MOQ-EXT-NET-HANDLING               August 2024


   The stream's metadata includes explicit XR metadata defined by 3GPP
   as part of the RTP header extension, except for the fields which
   pertain to individual PDUs, which can be derived unambiguously from
   QUIC signalling (derivation of E and PSN is described in section
   3.1).

   *  Mandatory fields:

      -  PSI (4)

      -  D (1)

      -  PSSN (10)

   *  Optional fields are dependent on application-layer signalling to
      be present (e.g., new fields in publication and subscription
      messages, in catalog).

      -  PSSize (24)

      -  NPDS (16)

   *  Additional fields are conditional to completion of the RTP header
      extension work in Release 19 of 3GPP.

      -  BSize should be present in the first stream of a burst

      -  TTNB should be signalled in the last stream of a burst (e.g.,
         if possible, in a trailing position in the stream).

3.  Traffic Handling of High-Throughput Low-Latency Traffic

3.1.  MOQ Relay Behavior

   A MOQ relay at the ingress point of a wireless network extracts
   metadata associated with PDU sets.

   In datagram mode, the relay obtains all XR metadata from the datagram
   XR header.

   In stream mode, the relay obtains the XR metadata fields from the
   stream header.  The MOQ relay derives the following XR metadata,
   which is not present in the stream header:

   *  E is derived from the FIN flag of the QUIC stream






de Foy, et al.            Expires 1 March 2025                  [Page 8]

Internet-Draft            MOQ-EXT-NET-HANDLING               August 2024


   *  PSN is generated based on the QUIC/UDP/IP packets received in
      order of STREAM frame offset.  In case there are missing packets,
      the relay can use the STREAM frame offset and path MTU to
      determine the sequence number of a packet received after one or
      more missing packets.

   E and PSN are derived for each PDU of the stream.

3.2.  Endpoint Behavior

   To enable XR traffic handling, a MOQ client should set up a MOQ
   connection through a MOQ relay providing this functionality.
   Discovery of such relay is out of scope of this document.

   The MOQ server is configured to send XR metadata with a media stream.
   Both MOQ server and client can include an "xr-handling" field in
   (respectively) publication and subscription messages, to indicate
   support for sending and receiving XR metadata.  The catalog can also
   include an "xr-handling" field to indicate support for XR metadata
   for a track.  [TBD: use a mechanism to agree on specific optional
   metadata to be sent - including whether optional fields are included,
   and whether release 19 fields are included]

   Prior to sending a datagram, an endpoint determines the XR metadata
   applicable to a datagram, and, if applicable, add a datagram XR
   metadata header in the datagram.  [TBD: the datagram XR metadata
   header should be placed after the MOQ header?  Need to define a
   mechanism to extend the MOQ datagram header].

   Prior to sending a stream, an endpoint determines the XR metadata
   applicable to a stream, and, if applicable, add a stream XR metadata
   header in the stream.  [TBD: the stream XR metadata header should be
   placed after the MOQ stream header?  Need to define a mechanism to
   extend the MOQ stream header].

4.  Security Considerations

   To enable support for the feature described in this document, the
   application exposes metadata to a MOQ relay under the control of a
   network or service operator.  End-to-end encrypted media is not
   exposed to the MOQ relay, so this is not seen as a high-risk
   exposure.

   The fields defined in the Release 18 of 3GPP are included in this
   appendix, for the reader's convenience (text copied from [TS26.522]
   V18.1.0 with minor adaptations and omissions of some notes for
   readability):

   *  *End PDU of the PDU Set [E]* (1 bit): This field is a flag that
      shall be set to 1 for the last PDU of the PDU Set and set to 0 for
      all other PDUs of the PDU Set.

   *  *End of Data Burst [D]* (1 bit): This field is a flag that shall
      be set to 1 for the last PDU of a Data Burst.  It shall be set to
      0 for all other PDUs.  A Data Burst may consist of one or more PDU
      Sets.

   *  *PDU Set Importance [PSI]* (4 bits): The PDU Set Importance field
      indicates the importance of this PDU Set compared to other PDU
      Sets within the same Multimedia Session.  This information may
      help RAN to discard PDUs, when needed.  Lower values shall
      indicate a higher importance PDU Set, with the highest importance
      PDU Set indicated by 1 and the lowest importance PDU Set indicated
      by 15.  When the RTP sender cannot define an importance, it shall
      set the value to 0.

   *  *PDU Set Sequence Number [PSSN]* (10 bits): The sequence number of
      the PDU Set to which the current PDU belongs, acting as a 10-bit
      numerical identifier for the PDU Set. The PSSN shall be
      incremented monotonically by 1 for each subsequent PDU Set.

   NOTE: This value wraps around at 1023, however, using the 16-bit RTP
   packet sequence number and PSSN pair, a receiver may uniquely
   distinguish between any PDU Sets.

   *  *PDU Sequence Number within a PDU Set [PSN]* (6 bits): The
      sequence number of the current PDU within the PDU Set. The PSN
      shall be set to 0 for the first PDU in the PDU Set and incremented
      monotonically for every PDU in the PDU Set in the order of
      transmission from the sender.

   NOTE: A receiver may use the RTP packet sequence number together with
   the PSN to distinguish between PDUs within a PDU Set that contains
   more than 64 PDUs.

   *  *PDU Set Size [PSSize]* (24 bits): The PDU Set Size indicates the
      total size of all PDUs of the PDU Set to which this PDU belongs.
      This field is optional and subject to an SDP signaling offer/
      answer negotiation, where the RTP sender shall indicate whether it

      will provide the size of the PDU Set for that RTP stream.  If not
      enabled, the field shall not be present within the RTP HE.  If
      enabled, but the RTP sender is not able to determine the PDU Set
      Size for a particular PDU Set, it shall set the value to 0 in all
      PDUs of that PDU Set. The PSSize shall indicate the size of a PDU
      Set including RTP/UDP/IP header encapsulation overhead of its
      corresponding PDUs.  The PSSize shall be expressed in bytes.  It
      is recommended to add the PDU Set Size field when the Number of
      PDUs in the PDU Set field is present.

   NOTE: This field may be optionally present given the signaling of the
   "pdu-set-size" extension attribute in the SDP offer/answer
   negotiation.

   *  *Number of PDUs in the PDU Set [NPDS]* (16 bits): The number of
      PDUs within the PDU Set indicates the total number of PDUs
      belonging to the same PDU Set. This field is optional and subject
      to an SDP signaling offer/answer negotiation, where the RTP sender
      may indicate whether it will provide the number of PDUs within the
      PDU Set for that RTP stream.  If enabled, but the RTP sender is
      not able to determine the Number of PDUs in the PDU Set, it shall
      set the value to 0 in all PDUs of that PDU Set.  It is recommended
      to add the Number of PDUs in the PDU Set field when the PDU Set
      Size field is present.

   NOTE: This field may be optionally present given the signaling of the
   "num-pdus-in-pdu-set" extension attribute in the SDP offer/answer
   negotiation.

A.2.  Release 19 XR Metadata

   Potential additional fields in the Release 19 of 3GPP include (text
   based on work in progress in [TR23.700-70]):

   *  *Burst size [BSize]*: this field describes the size of a burst of
      traffic, which includes one or more PDU sets.

   *  *Time-to-next-burst [TTNB]*: this field describes the time between
      the end of the present burst and the beginning of the next burst.
